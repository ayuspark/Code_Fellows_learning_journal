Today we are finally learning DOM. I felt like there are tons of APIs that I find it hard to remember them all. Not being able to keep a good memory of these APIs hinders me from efficiently call the object's methods, hence limited DOM manipulation.

I read that the white space will mess up the element selection since since in most browsers they would be treated as an element. Urgh, complicated. Rumors on the street that jQuery could save us all. Looking forward to that day.

Still overwhelmed by so many ways to manipulate the DOM.

This afternoon I went to the Google UX study. Fun! As someone who has 100% brand loyalty, I gave them some really well-though feedback. And then I fantasize that they would hire me bcuz my answers were too awesome. But of course it didn't work that way. I left. SO SAD!
