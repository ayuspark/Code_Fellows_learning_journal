Today is for the near future the last study day at Code Fellows.
I was happy to see many projects and regret our projects being so simple. Although we have utilised all we have learned in our project. Well, it would have been much harder to distribute work were we to do something with more complexity.
Alas, at least we had a good time.

I was surprised that the lunch catering is Thai. Not regular catering food such as pizza or subpar Mexican food. Good job Code Fellows!

I will keep in touch with Sam and Admission to let them know my experience over at the east side boot camp. Urgh.... we'll see.

It was a nice experience with CF. I am very happy with my choice!
