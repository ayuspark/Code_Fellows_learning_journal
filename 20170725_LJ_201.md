### 20170725_LJ_201
I didn't have the chance to write the learning journal yesterday.
I was soooo tired after working from 13:30 nonstop to 20:30. This is just stupid! I was the last one of our class to leave the campus. I was NOT expecting the BusMall proj to take me that much time -- since in the class I had a clear head and map of the approach. I regret not actually putting them down in a flow chart. So I let my thought flow, I tried out using createElement to make img tags and dynamically generate images on the DOM. But I was lost how to track the clicks and votes since it's dynamically created.

Ahlala, so I have to abandon that idea by 17:00.

But I am happy now cuz my code looks dry(I think) and the logic is tight and clear.

I was also very glad that Sam showed us step by step moving boxes. It may seem tedious (I don't think) but it's exactly what I needed.
