Modularity is cool. For someone who has OCD, having everything modularized is soothing and comforting. Like have div wrapping all related content, have code in groups with right amount of whitespace, this is cool. I hope there can be more UI and design concept taught in class, like design trend, popular layout etc.

Touched a tiny bit on function. Looking forward to objects. Things would be a lot more fun when we get to objects I think/hope.

Git is interesting. All the merge/branch/conflict questions. I think the best way to learn is through try-and-error. I still don't understand how git resolve/detect the merge conflict. Maybe I cannot push this LJ again. Let's see.
