Today we learned about local storage, for whatever reason I didn't understand the reading from yesterday urgh.

The lab went much better after consulting John. This week apprently I am not doing very great because I didn't even do stretch goals.

Too bad I will not be able to attend 301, especially I am really into web dev now!

All the reading from Sam are great! I will read them when I get time.
