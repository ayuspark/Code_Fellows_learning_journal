This second week has been fun!
I felt like we have made a relatively bigger step than the previous one. The projects are a bit more demanding and the course content now makes more sense to me: crunching the JS practice in the first half of the week, and then ease into CSS.

I think when solving JS problems, the outcome and debugging process are easy to see - it's an instant of fail or pass; with CSS, it's more of a long process constituted by continuous tweaking and manipulating. It makes sense to leave it till the end of the week when we have more time to fool around with layouts.

I think it'd be helpful if we can see how the layouts are actually achieved, what attribute is used to style and organize the elements.
