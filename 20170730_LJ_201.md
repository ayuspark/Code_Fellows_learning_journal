Today is the first day of the project week. I spent the entire week contemplating how the project should be constructed, and the layout. It appeared in my dream. That's very annoying. I know that the idea is very meaningless and silly fun, not as educational as other team's algorithm demonstration or battleship whatnot. But to have a functional website that attracts people, this is good enough for the goal of our project, I think.

But funny enough, the whole week of wire framing, was replaced by good design in less a morning by our team. The team came up with better ideas and made the site much more attractive.

Most of the skeleton is up. Looking forward to tomorrow.
