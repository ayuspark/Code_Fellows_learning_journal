Today we got the functionality done. By the end of day, we are already beautifying the site.
I am adding a modal box on the game page, which is a fun feature to learn. My animation skill definitely got better by doing this project. Our team is getting along, I am very happy about that. Maybe our project isn't very brainy, but I think we are having fun doing it. Two more days!
