Today we finally started talking about CSS layout and UI/UX a little bit. Sam reintroduced the concept of wireframe, and a cool placeholder website called placehold.it/<some number>x<some number>

JS debugger is so cool! I would love to learn more about fully utilising the dev tool on Chrome.

I still don't know what to make for the final project. As of now(20170721, 9:34PST), I am very intimidated by the previous projects. Holy cow they are good.

Still lamenting about CSS. It is time consuming and I don't know how to troubleshooting it. Is there a "debugger" feature I can use?
