Today we went over the semantic tags HTML (80% of the time), glanced at CSS, and quickly touched upon JS. The content seemed still within control, look forward some more detailed content in the coming classes. It's only day 2.

But of course the homework would become a rabbit hole! Since we didn't really practice CSS and html in class, I am just clumsily trying to form a structure with the knowledge I gleaned from the past. Then I started to look into why this works and that doesn't, how to make columns on a page without bootstrap, how can I have columns instead of floating containers, are they the same... then bam, it's late again. So my lab had ambition but finished in a rush.

This afternoon I went to the interview with MSFT. Christ that interviewer doesn't have any patience. I don't think I get to even finish just one sentence! I was upset leaving the campus :(. I wonder if all tech interviews are rushed and constantly pumping people for answers. Stupid 520 then took away 1.5 hours from my lab time.

Looking forward to ask the TAs or Sam my questions tmr. It's all about moving boxes.

One more observations: WHY ON EARTH ALL I LEARNED IN THE PAST 1 YEAR ABOUT HTML ARE IN DIVS!!???????
