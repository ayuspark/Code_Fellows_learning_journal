### 20170806_LJ_201
Today a couple of classmates and I had brunch together.
I didn't learn anything particular, just lamenting that I will be going to the bloody east side coding camp and leaving CF.

Urgh.

I hope that this little 201 group can stay in touch, and we would continue making jokes and share info.

Now I start to worry: am I supposed to learn something today? Or it is a journal from days ago that I totally lost track of date? I know that tomorrow I will be learning some algorithm which god knows how they are going to teach us. Oh man, I am so having this ominous feeling.

Urgh.

Jealous that the other students would continue to learn MVC, and database and all the fancy stuff with Code Fellows.

Take care.
